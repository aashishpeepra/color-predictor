# color-predictor
It uses some mathematical equations (which I wrote from scratch) to figure out what kind of background either black or white suits the color that you pass to it.
This is written purely in Python without the use of many other machine learning library.

The api.py is the API version of the Machine Learning code i wrote so you can use the API anywhere by simply hosting it on platforms like heroku (no promotion)
